# b-on-rails

I'm *still* building this app for a students NGO. It's meant to be pretty basic, with blog-like features. The user can manage member, posts, and services.
It is made to combine both AngularJS and Rails. The reliable tutorails I found on the net are:
* [JCole Morrison's tutorial](http://start.jcolemorrison.com/angularjs-rails-4-1-and-ui-router-tutorial/)
* [Thinkster's tutorial](https://thinkster.io/angular-rails/)

Find here the working board : [Trello] (https://trello.com/b/yEB6ZDxF/ruby-project)
To get access to it : [sign in](https://trello.com/) then prompt me to add you.
