# b-on-rails

I  built this app for a students NGO. It's meant to be pretty basic, with blog-like features.

The user can manage member, posts, and projects.

It is made to combine both AngularJS and Rails. 

Once you make sure you have rails set up on your system,

run 
```sh
bundle install 
```
to install all the gems. The 
```sh
rake bower:install 
```

to install the modules required by angular.
For some unknown reasons, rake bower:install does not install the required packages. 
For the time being, the modules are installed manually directly from the git repo.

Don't forget 
```sh
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```
for the database management.

For the beginners in Rails or/and Angular, there are two main tutorials I recommend :
* [JCole Morrison's tutorial](http://start.jcolemorrison.com/angularjs-rails-4-1-and-ui-router-tutorial/)
* [Thinkster's tutorial](https://thinkster.io/angular-rails/)

I actually started from a free Bootstrap template: [Flat Theme](https://shapebootstrap.net/item/1524965-flat-theme-free-responsive-multipurpose-site-template) then implemented AngularJS and Rails part.

# Ruby on Rails 

This application requires : 
* Ruby version 2.0.0
* Rails version 4.2.4

# AngularJS

This application uses [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)

Angular Modules required :
* [angular-animate](https://github.com/angular/bower-angular-animate.git) : provides [animation hooks](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/animations) for common directives such as ngRepeat, ngSwitch, and ngView, as well as custom directives via the $animate service. 
* [angular-ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) manages the routings on the client-side service 
* [angular-bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) : bootstrap components written in pure angular
* [ng-file-upload](https://github.com/danialfarid/ng-file-upload) : an awesome Lightweight Angular directive to upload files with optional FileAPI shim for cross browser support
* [angular-devise](https://github.com/cloudspace/angular_devise) : A small AngularJS Service to interact with *Devise* Authentication.
* [angular-sanitize](https://github.com/angular/bower-angular-sanitize) : Sanitizes an html string by stripping all potentially dangerous tokens.

To make sure that Rails allows angular to handle our client side routing, the following two lines were added in app/assets/javascripts/application.js:
```sh
root 'application#index'
get '*path' => 'application#index'
```
ui.bootstrap is disabled for compatibility reasons. This issue should be resolved before deployment.

# Database

This application uses MySQL with ActiveRecord.
The gem [mysql2](https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2) supplies with the adapter to the database.
The Mysql2 gem is meant to serve the extremely common use-case of connecting, querying and iterating on results. 
Some database libraries out there serve as direct 1:1 mappings of the already complex C APIs available. This one is not.

# Carrierwave

This application uses [carrierwave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) for the uploading feature.
The default storage directory is in /public/uploads/:model/:mountedas/:model.id.
To change the directory, the store_dir method should be overridden in app/assets/uploader

It is used for the picture uploading feature.

Carrierwave uses [minimagick](https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick) to process some images i.e resizing large pictures. ImageMagick is required before!


# Overall architecture

The app wires AngularJS and Rails. Rails manages the server-side and angular the client-side. Therefore, Rails does not generate the templates itself.
The main views are :
* Home or > Accueil
* About-us or > L'association
* Services > or > Notre action 
* Blog 
* Contact

Please refer to app.js to set/get the different states. The path is : app/assets/javascripts/app.js
The editable **templates** are located at : app/assets/templates
If ever the design i.e .css files and scss files has to be upgraded, refer to css folder : app/assets/javascripts/ng-app/css
The **ngControllers** can be found at : app/assets/javascripts/ng-app/controllers

In few words, the app.js sets the front-end configuration. Each controller is associated to a service that provides that data needed in a given page.
For example, in app/assets/javascripts/ng-app/controllers/blog.js there is : the posts services that provides blog posts to the BlogCtrl, which in return 
manages the blog-item.html.erb found in app/assets/templates/.
